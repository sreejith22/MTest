I wanted to respond directly on the author\'s page, but they seem to be having a problem taking comments.<p>The reason why I make history videos is that many people I know (many of whom are quite educated) don\'t even have a basic scaffold of world events in their minds (or the potential causality between events).  Most American high school and college students would find it difficult to give even a summary of the Vietnam War or the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Many of these people have sat through years of traditional history classes (taught through state-mandated books by \"experts\").  Even more worrying is many experts who have taken one side or another of a historical issue and view their viewpoints as facts (this is the tone of most history books).<p>If the author really watched my videos, he would see that I start most of them telling the listener to be skeptical of anything I tell them or anyone tells them; that no matter how footnoted something is, in the end it is dependent on people\'s accounts--the people who weren\'t killed--which are subject to bias (no matter how well-intentioned).  Very few history books or professors do this.  If anything, they create a false sense of certainty.<p>As for the \"one voice\" issue, I don\'t see how a guy making digestible videos that inform and encourage skepticism (on YouTube where anyone else can do the same) are more dangerous than state-mandated text books.  I don\'t see how lectures that are open for the world to scrutinize (and comment about on YouTube and our site) are more dangerous than a lone teacher or professor who can say whatever they like to their classrooms with no one there to correct or dispute them.<p>Finally, there is nothing I would like to see more than other teachers/professors/experts adding their voice to the mix.  Rather than wasting energy commenting on other people\'s work with pseudo-intellectual babble, why don\'t they produce their own videos and post them on YouTube?  If someone can produce 20 videos that seem decent and want to do more as part of the Khan Academy, we\'ll point our audience at them.  If our students respond, we\'ll figure out a way that they can potentially make it a career.<p>regards,\nSal', '2021-06-25 12:38:46', NULL),
(2, 9, 'tptacek', 'This entire event was a staged press op. Keith Alexander is a ~30 year veteran of SIGINT, electronic warfare, and intelligence, and a Four-Star US Army General --- which is a bigger deal than you probably think it is. He&#x27;s a spy chief in the truest sense <i>and</i> a master politician. Anyone who thinks he walked into that conference hall in Caesars without a near perfect forecast of the outcome of the speech is kidding themselves.<p>Heckling Alexander played right into the strategy. It gave him an opportunity to look reasonable compared to his detractors, and, more generally (and alarmingly), to have the NSA look more reasonable compared to opponents of NSA surveillance. It allowed him to &quot;split the vote&quot; with audience reactions, getting people who probably have serious misgivings about NSA programs to applaud his calm and graceful handling of shouted insults; many of those people probably applauded simply to protest the hecklers, who after all were making it harder for them to follow what Alexander was trying to say.<p>There was no serious Q&amp;A on offer at the keynote. The questions were pre-screened; all attendees could do was vote on them. There was no possibility that anything would come of this speech other than an effectively unchallenged full-throated defense of the NSA&#x27;s programs.<p>Even the premise of the keynote was calculated to wrong-foot NSA opponents. However much you might want to hear Alexander account for the activities of the NSA, the NSA itself is not the real oversight mechanism for the NSA! My guess is that no pol with meaningful oversight over NSA would have consented to address a room full of technology professionals about NSA&#x27;s programs; they were happy to send NSA&#x27;s own supremely well-trained figurehead to do that for them.<p>I think a walkout might have been effective, had it been organized well enough in advance (perhaps with some of the same aplomb as the [I think misguided] opposition to CISPA); at least you&#x27;d get some stinging photos.', '2021-06-25 12:38:47', NULL),
(3, 9, 'nirvana', 'I worked at Amazon from before Steve left to sometime later.  I remember being excited when Larry Tessler was hired, and dismayed at the way he was treated.   Everything Steve says about Amazon is true, only, it was much worse.  Amazon was, by far, the worst employment experience I\'ve ever had. I\'m not saying that lightly, I worked for a dozen startups, a couple of which crashed hard in the most gut wrenchingly painful way you could imagine.  (Though by far most of my experiences were positive.)<p>Amazon was a purely political environment where, if you weren\'t watching your back you\'d get stabbed and become a rung in someone else\'s ladder.  In our group, the manager had zero engineering experience (literally had gone to college to be a prison guard, somehow ended up \"managing\" programmers, though barely computer literate.)  In fact, it was so bad that when I\'d finally had enough, and quit[1] (because my transfer to the AWS team was blocked by the prison guard) I vowed never to work for anyone else, ever again.   Which means, I <i>had</i> to do a startup.<p>Anyway, the SOA effort was in full swing when I was there.  It was a pain, and it was a mess because every team did things differently and every API was different and based on different assumptions and written in a different language.<p>But I want to correct the misperception that this lead to AWS.  It didn\'t.  S3 was written by its own team, from scratch.  At the time I was at Amazon, working on the retail site, none of Amazon.com was running on AWS.  I know, when AWS was announced, with great fanfare, they said \"the services that power Amazon.com can now power your business!\" or words to that effect.  This was a flat out lie.  The only thing they shared was data centers and a standard hardware configuration.  Even by the time I left, when AWS was running full steam ahead (and probably running Reddit already), none of Amazon.com was running on AWS, except for a few, small, experimental and relatively new projects.   I\'m sure more of it has been adopted now, but AWS was always a separate team (and a better managed one, from what I could see.)<p>Regarding Bezos\'s micromanagement:  I do remember, one fall, in the run up to christmas, surfacing an issue with the site several times. My manager told me that his boss didn\'t want to change it, but I knew it was a bug.  I went above his bosses head and told that guy (who was a Bezos report) about it.  I even cced Bezos on an email about it, and of course, the VP chewed out his underling who chewed out his boss, who chewed out me.<p>Then, at 3AM, the night before I was supposed to fly out to visit my parents for thanksgiving at 10AM, I was awakened[2] and made to fix the problem.  The problem I\'d wanted to fix 2-3 months earlier. The problem I\'d gotten chewed out for trying to surface but been told \"won\'t fix\" all the way up and down the chain of command.  Because Bezos had gone to buy something on the site and had seen the problem himself.  So, my thanksgiving trip was ruined, of course, and I had to do it- RIGHT THAT MINUTE- in the middle of the night.<p>The icing? After fixing it and going back to bed, and coming in the next day (which was a vacation day, mind you, as I was supposed to fly that day...) I got chewed out by my boss for coming in at 10am.<p>I don\'t know about you, but if you get woken up at 3am and spend 2 hours coding, you should be allowed to show up for work the next morning at 10am.<p>Bezos was right that it needed to be fixed. However, he must be a B player because his direct report was a C player who wouldn\'t let me fix it when it was discovered.<p>Yeah, I wouldn\'t recommend you go work at Amazon.[3]<p>Sorry if I\'ve gotten off topic.  It\'s rare that you can find candid descriptions of what it\'s like to work somewhere.... since Steve felt free to be candid, I figured I\'d share my experiences.  I also worked for other large companies, like, for instance, Microsoft.  Microsoft was weird in a sort of cult like way, and had its own management problems, but was much more enjoyable... and really treated their employees a whole lot better.  At MSFT, hardship was having to share your office with another programmer.  At Amazon, I was literally in a hallway, with a dozen other people, with major foot traffic walking past my desk (And right behind my chair) all day long, a lot of noise and a very large window over my shoulder reflecting right into my monitor... all day long.<p>Worst Job Ever.<p>Thank you for indulging my venting.<p>[1] It wasn\'t just me either, by the time I left, %60 of the team had already gotten internal transfers or resigned. I was being loyal, and went to HR to try and get some advice or mediation, but despite being promised confidentiality, the notes of my meeting with the HR rep were forwarded to my boss.<p>[2] At amazon they have this crazy idea that engineers should have pagers. I\'m sure it sounded great at the time. I didn\'t have the pager that week, but that didn\'t matter to the boss[4], who knew I\'d been the one to find the issue.  So he called me.  I think the phone rang for a good 20 minutes before I woke up.<p>Never let your employer give you a pager, unless you\'re an ops guy.<p>[3] After I left, and after my team was literally decimated by the hostile environment created by our boss, I found out he got promoted!  Yep, now he\'s managing managers.<p>[4] Why was the boss up at 3am?  Well, Bezos called him, but he\'d been up already... he was a hard partier who, just between you and me, also was selling drugs on the side.  Most of the stoners in PacMed were getting their bags from him.', '2021-06-25 12:38:47', NULL),
(4, 9, 'pitdesi', 'It now 404\'s so I\'ve posted it here:<p>Stevey\'s Google Platforms Rant<p>I was at Amazon for about six and a half years, and now I\'ve been at Google for that long. One thing that struck me immediately about the two companies -- an impression that has been reinforced almost daily -- is that Amazon does everything wrong, and Google does everything right. Sure, it\'s a sweeping generalization, but a surprisingly accurate one. It\'s pretty crazy. There are probably a hundred or even two hundred different ways you can compare the two companies, and Google is superior in all but three of them, if I recall correctly. I actually did a spreadsheet at one point but Legal wouldn\'t let me show it to anyone, even though recruiting loved it.<p>I mean, just to give you a very brief taste: Amazon\'s recruiting process is fundamentally flawed by having teams hire for themselves, so their hiring bar is incredibly inconsistent across teams, despite various efforts they\'ve made to level it out. And their operations are a mess; they don\'t really have SREs and they make engineers pretty much do everything, which leaves almost no time for coding - though again this varies by group, so it\'s luck of the draw. They don\'t give a single shit about charity or helping the needy or community contributions or anything like that. Never comes up there, except maybe to laugh about it. Their facilities are dirt-smeared cube farms without a dime spent on decor or common meeting areas. Their pay and benefits suck, although much less so lately due to local competition from Google and Facebook. But they don\'t have any of our perks or extras -- they just try to match the offer-letter numbers, and that\'s the end of it. Their code base is a disaster, with no engineering standards whatsoever except what individual teams choose to put in place.<p>To be fair, they do have a nice versioned-library system that we really ought to emulate, and a nice publish-subscribe system that we also have no equivalent for. But for the most part they just have a bunch of crappy tools that read and write state machine information into relational databases. We wouldn\'t take most of it even if it were free.<p>I think the pubsub system and their library-shelf system were two out of the grand total of three things Amazon does better than google.<p>I guess you could make an argument that their bias for launching early and iterating like mad is also something they do well, but you can argue it either way. They prioritize launching early over everything else, including retention and engineering discipline and a bunch of other stuff that turns out to matter in the long run. So even though it\'s given them some competitive advantages in the marketplace, it\'s created enough other problems to make it something less than a slam-dunk.<p>But there\'s one thing they do really really well that pretty much makes up for ALL of their political, philosophical and technical screw-ups.<p>Jeff Bezos is an infamous micro-manager. He micro-manages every single pixel of Amazon\'s retail site. He hired Larry Tesler, Apple\'s Chief Scientist and probably the very most famous and respected human-computer interaction expert in the entire world, and then ignored every goddamn thing Larry said for three years until Larry finally -- wisely -- left the company. Larry would do these big usability studies and demonstrate beyond any shred of doubt that nobody can understand that frigging website, but Bezos just couldn\'t let go of those pixels, all those millions of semantics-packed pixels on the landing page. They were like millions of his own precious children. So they\'re all still there, and Larry is not.<p>Micro-managing isn\'t that third thing that Amazon does better than us, by the way. I mean, yeah, they micro-manage really well, but I wouldn\'t list it as a strength or anything. I\'m just trying to set the context here, to help you understand what happened. We\'re talking about a guy who in all seriousness has said on many public occasions that people should be paying him to work at Amazon. He hands out little yellow stickies with his name on them, reminding people \"who runs the company\" when they disagree with him. The guy is a regular... well, Steve Jobs, I guess. Except without the fashion or design sense. Bezos is super smart; don\'t get me wrong. He just makes ordinary control freaks look like stoned hippies.<p>So one day Jeff Bezos issued a mandate. He\'s doing that all the time, of course, and people scramble like ants being pounded with a rubber mallet whenever it happens. But on one occasion -- back around 2002 I think, plus or minus a year -- he issued a mandate that was so out there, so huge and eye-bulgingly ponderous, that it made all of his other mandates look like unsolicited peer bonuses.<p>His Big Mandate went something along these lines:<p>1) All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.<p>2) Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.<p>3) There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team\'s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.<p>4) It doesn\'t matter what technology they use. HTTP, Corba, Pubsub, custom protocols -- doesn\'t matter. Bezos doesn\'t care.<p>5) All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.<p>6) Anyone who doesn\'t do this will be fired.<p>7) Thank you; have a nice day!<p>Ha, ha! You 150-odd ex-Amazon folks here will of course realize immediately that #7 was a little joke I threw in, because Bezos most definitely does not give a shit about your day.<p>#6, however, was quite real, so people went to work. Bezos assigned a couple of Chief Bulldogs to oversee the effort and ensure forward progress, headed up by Uber-Chief Bear Bulldog Rick Dalzell. Rick is an ex-Armgy Ranger, West Point Academy graduate, ex-boxer, ex-Chief Torturer slash CIO at Wal*Mart, and is a big genial scary man who used the word \"hardened interface\" a lot. Rick was a walking, talking hardened interface himself, so needless to say, everyone made LOTS of forward progress and made sure Rick knew about it.<p>Over the next couple of years, Amazon transformed internally into a service-oriented architecture. They learned a tremendous amount while effecting this transformation. There was lots of existing documentation and lore about SOAs, but at Amazon\'s vast scale it was about as useful as telling Indiana Jones to look both ways before crossing the street. Amazon\'s dev staff made a lot of discoveries along the way. A teeny tiny sampling of these discoveries included:<p>- pager escalation gets way harder, because a ticket might bounce through 20 service calls before the real owner is identified. If each bounce goes through a team with a 15-minute response time, it can be hours before the right team finally finds out, unless you build a lot of scaffolding and metrics and reporting.<p>- every single one of your peer teams suddenly becomes a potential DOS attacker. Nobody can make any real forward progress until very serious quotas and throttling are put in place in every single service.<p>- monitoring and QA are the same thing. You\'d never think so until you try doing a big SOA. But when your service says \"oh yes, I\'m fine\", it may well be the case that the only thing still functioning in the server is the little component that knows how to say \"I\'m fine, roger roger, over and out\" in a cheery droid voice. In order to tell whether the service is actually responding, you have to make individual calls. The problem continues recursively until your monitoring is doing comprehensive semantics checking of your entire range of services and data, at which point it\'s indistinguishable from automated QA. So they\'re a continuum.<p>- if you have hundreds of services, and your code MUST communicate with other groups\' code via these services, then you won\'t be able to find any of them without a service-discovery mechanism. And you can\'t have that without a service registration mechanism, which itself is another service. So Amazon has a universal service registry where you can find out reflectively (programmatically) about every service, what its APIs are, and also whether it is currently up, and where.<p>- debugging problems with someone else\'s code gets a LOT harder, and is basically impossible unless there is a universal standard way to run every service in a debuggable sandbox.<p>That\'s just a very small sample. There are dozens, maybe hundreds of individual learnings like these that Amazon had to discover organically. There were a lot of wacky ones around externalizing services, but not as many as you might think. Organizing into services taught teams not to trust each other in most of the same ways they\'re not supposed to trust external developers.<p>This effort was still underway when I left to join Google in mid-2005, but it was pretty far advanced. From the time Bezos issued his edict through the time I left, Amazon had transformed culturally into a company that thinks about everything in a services-first fashion. It is now fundamental to how they approach all designs, including internal designs for stuff that might never see the light of day externally.<p>At this point they don\'t even do it out of fear of being fired. I mean, they\'re still afraid of that; it\'s pretty much part of daily life there, working for the Dread Pirate Bezos and all. But they do services because they\'ve come to understand that it\'s the Right Thing. There are without question pros and cons to the SOA approach, and some of the cons are pretty long. But overall it\'s the right thing because SOA-driven design enables Platforms.<p>That\'s what Bezos was up to with his edict, of course. He didn\'t (and doesn\'t) care even a tiny bit about the well-being of the teams, nor about what technologies they use, nor in fact any detail whatsoever about how they go about their business unless they happen to be screwing up. But Bezos realized long before the vast majority of Amazonians that Amazon needs to be a platform.<p>You wouldn\'t really think that an online bookstore needs to be an extensible, programmable platform. Would you?<p>Well, the first big thing Bezos realized is that the infrastructure they\'d built for selling and shipping books and sundry could be transformed an excellent repurposable computing platform. So now they have the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, and the Amazon Elastic MapReduce, and the Amazon Relational Database Service, and a whole passel\' o\' other services browsable at aws.amazon.com. These services host the backends for some pretty successful companies, reddit being my personal favorite of the bunch.<p>The other big realization he had was that he can\'t always build the right thing. I think Larry Tesler might have struck some kind of chord in Bezos when he said his mom couldn\'t use the goddamn website. It\'s not even super clear whose mom he was talking about, and doesn\'t really matter, because nobody\'s mom can use the goddamn website. In fact I myself find the website disturbingly daunting, and I worked there for over half a decade. I\'ve just learned to kinda defocus my eyes and concentrate on the million or so pixels near the center of the page above the fold.<p>I\'m not really sure how Bezos came to this realization -- the insight that he can\'t build one product and have it be right for everyone. But it doesn\'t matter, because he gets it. There\'s actually a formal name for this phenomenon. It\'s called Accessibility, and it\'s the most important thing in the computing world.<p>The. Most. Important. Thing.<p>If you\'re sorta thinking, \"huh? You mean like, blind and deaf people Accessibility?\" then you\'re not alone, because I\'ve come to understand that there are lots and LOTS of people just like you: people for whom this idea does not have the right Accessibility, so it hasn\'t been able to get through to you yet. It\'s not your fault for not understanding, any more than it would be your fault for being blind or deaf or motion-restricted or living with any other disability. When software -- or idea-ware for that matter -- fails to be accessible to anyone for any reason, it is the fault of the software or of the messaging of the idea. It is an Accessibility failure.<p>Like anything else big and important in life, Accessibility has an evil twin who, jilted by the unbalanced affection displayed by their parents in their youth, has grown into an equally powerful Arch-Nemesis (yes, there\'s more than one nemesis to accessibility) named Security. And boy howdy are the two ever at odds.<p>But I\'ll argue that Accessibility is actually more important than Security because dialing Accessibility to zero means you have no product at all, whereas dialing Security to zero can still get you a reasonably successful product such as the Playstation Network.<p>So yeah. In case you hadn\'t noticed, I could actually write a book on this topic. A fat one, filled with amusing anecdotes about ants and rubber mallets at companies I\'ve worked at. But I will never get this little rant published, and you\'ll never get it read, unless I start to wrap up.<p>That one last thing that Google doesn\'t do well is Platforms. We don\'t understand platforms. We don\'t \"get\" platforms. Some of you do, but you are the minority. This has become painfully clear to me over the past six years. I was kind of hoping that competitive pressure from Microsoft and Amazon and more recently Facebook would make us wake up collectively and start doing universal services. Not in some sort of ad-hoc, half-assed way, but in more or less the same way Amazon did it: all at once, for real, no cheating, and treating it as our top priority from now on.<p>But no. No, it\'s like our tenth or eleventh priority. Or fifteenth, I don\'t know. It\'s pretty low. There are a few teams who treat the idea very seriously, but most teams either don\'t think about it all, ever, or only a small percentage of them think about it in a very small way.<p>It\'s a big stretch even to get most teams to offer a stubby service to get programmatic access to their data and computations. Most of them think they\'re building products. And a stubby service is a pretty pathetic service. Go back and look at that partial list of learnings from Amazon, and tell me which ones Stubby gives you out of the box. As far as I\'m concerned, it\'s none of them. Stubby\'s great, but it\'s like parts when you need a car.<p>A product is useless without a platform, or more precisely and accurately, a platform-less product will always be replaced by an equivalent platform-ized product.<p>Google+ is a prime example of our complete failure to understand platforms from the very highest levels of executive leadership (hi Larry, Sergey, Eric, Vic, howdy howdy) down to the very lowest leaf workers (hey yo). We all don\'t get it. The Golden Rule of platforms is that you Eat Your Own Dogfood. The Google+ platform is a pathetic afterthought. We had no API at all at launch, and last I checked, we had one measly API call. One of the team members marched in and told me about it when they launched, and I asked: \"So is it the Stalker API?\" She got all glum and said \"Yeah.\" I mean, I was joking, but no... the only API call we offer is to get someone\'s stream. So I guess the joke was on me.<p>Microsoft has known about the Dogfood rule for at least twenty years. It\'s been part of their culture for a whole generation now. You don\'t eat People Food and give your developers Dog Food. Doing that is simply robbing your long-term platform value for short-term successes. Platforms are all about long-term thinking.<p>Google+ is a knee-jerk reaction, a study in short-term thinking, predicated on the incorrect notion that Facebook is successful because they built a great product. But that\'s not why they are successful. Facebook is successful because they built an entire constellation of products by allowing other people to do the work. So Facebook is different for everyone. Some people spend all their time on Mafia Wars. Some spend all their time on Farmville. There are hundreds or maybe thousands of different high-quality time sinks available, so there\'s something there for everyone.<p>Our Google+ team took a look at the aftermarket and said: \"Gosh, it looks like we need some games. Let\'s go contract someone to, um, write some games for us.\" Do you begin to see how incredibly wrong that thinking is now? The problem is that we are trying to predict what people want and deliver it for them.<p>You can\'t do that. Not really. Not reliably. There have been precious few people in the world, over the entire history of computing, who have been able to do it reliably. Steve Jobs was one of them. We don\'t have a Steve Jobs here. I\'m sorry, but we don\'t.<p>Larry Tesler may have convinced Bezos that he was no Steve Jobs, but Bezos realized that he didn\'t need to be a Steve Jobs in order to provide everyone with the right products: interfaces and workflows that they liked and felt at ease with. He just needed to enable third-party developers to do it, and it would happen automatically.<p>I apologize to those (many) of you for whom all this stuff I\'m saying is incredibly obvious, because yeah. It\'s incredibly frigging obvious. Except we\'re not doing it. We don\'t get Platforms, and we don\'t get Accessibility. The two are basically the same thing, because platforms solve accessibility. A platform is accessibility.<p>So yeah, Microsoft gets it. And you know as well as I do how surprising that is, because they don\'t \"get\" much of anything, really. But they understand platforms as a purely accidental outgrowth of having started life in the business of providing platforms. So they have thirty-plus years of learning in this space. And if you go to msdn.com, and spend some time browsing, and you\'ve never seen it before, prepare to be amazed. Because it\'s staggeringly huge. They have thousands, and thousands, and THOUSANDS of API calls. They have a HUGE platform. Too big in fact, because they can\'t design for squat, but at least they\'re doing it.<p>Amazon gets it. Amazon\'s AWS (aws.amazon.com) is incredible. Just go look at it. Click around. It\'s embarrassing. We don\'t have any of that stuff.<p>Apple gets it, obviously. They\'ve made some fundamentally non-open choices, particularly around their mobile platform. But they understand accessibility and they understand the power of third-party development and they eat their dogfood. And you know what? They make pretty good dogfood. Their APIs are a hell of a lot cleaner than Microsoft\'s, and have been since time immemorial.<p>Facebook gets it. That\'s what really worries me. That\'s what got me off my lazy butt to write this thing. I hate blogging. I hate... plussing, or whatever it\'s called when you do a massive rant in Google+ even though it\'s a terrible venue for it but you do it anyway because in the end you really do want Google to be successful. And I do! I mean, Facebook wants me there, and it\'d be pretty easy to just go. But Google is home, so I\'m insisting that we have this little family intervention, uncomfortable as it might be.<p>After you\'ve marveled at the platform offerings of Microsoft and Amazon, and Facebook I guess (I didn\'t look because I didn\'t want to get too depressed), head over to developers.google.com and browse a little. Pretty big difference, eh? It\'s like what your fifth-grade nephew might mock up if he were doing an assignment to demonstrate what a big powerful platform company might be building if all they had, resource-wise, was one fifth grader.<p>Please don\'t get me wrong here -- I know for a fact that the dev-rel team has had to FIGHT to get even this much available externally. They\'re kicking ass as far as I\'m concerned, because they DO get platforms, and they are struggling heroically to try to create one in an environment that is at best platform-apathetic, and at worst often openly hostile to the idea.<p>I\'m just frankly describing what developers.google.com looks like to an outsider. It looks childish. Where\'s the Maps APIs in there for Christ\'s sake? Some of the things in there are labs projects. And the APIs for everything I clicked were... they were paltry. They were obviously dog food. Not even good organic stuff. Compared to our internal APIs it\'s all snouts and horse hooves.<p>And also don\'t get me wrong about Google+. They\'re far from the only offenders. This is a cultural thing. What we have going on internally is basically a war, with the underdog minority Platformers fighting a more or less losing battle against the Mighty Funded Confident Producters.<p>Any teams that have successfully internalized the notion that they should be externally programmable platforms from the ground up are underdogs -- Maps and Docs come to mind, and I know GMail is making overtures in that direction. But it\'s hard for them to get funding for it because it\'s not part of our culture. Maestro\'s funding is a feeble thing compared to the gargantuan Microsoft Office programming platform: it\'s a fluffy rabbit versus a T-Rex. The Docs team knows they\'ll never be competitive with Office until they can match its scripting facilities, but they\'re not getting any resource love. I mean, I assume they\'re not, given that Apps Script only works in Spreadsheet right now, and it doesn\'t even have keyboard shortcuts as part of its API. That team looks pretty unloved to me.<p>Ironically enough, Wave was a great platform, may they rest in peace. But making something a platform is not going to make you an instant success. A platform needs a killer app. Facebook -- that is, the stock service they offer with walls and friends and such -- is the killer app for the Facebook Platform. And it is a very serious mistake to conclude that the Facebook App could have been anywhere near as successful without the Facebook Platform.<p>You know how people are always saying Google is arrogant? I\'m a Googler, so I get as irritated as you do when people say that. We\'re not arrogant, by and large. We\'re, like, 99% Arrogance-Free. I did start this post -- if you\'ll reach back into distant memory -- by describing Google as \"doing everything right\". We do mean well, and for the most part when people say we\'re arrogant it\'s because we didn\'t hire them, or they\'re unhappy with our policies, or something along those lines. They\'re inferring arrogance because it makes them feel better.<p>But when we take the stance that we know how to design the perfect product for everyone, and believe you me, I hear that a lot, then we\'re being fools. You can attribute it to arrogance, or naivete, or whatever -- it doesn\'t matter in the end, because it\'s foolishness. There IS no perfect product for everyone.<p>And so we wind up with a browser that doesn\'t let you set the default font size. Talk about an affront to Accessibility. I mean, as I get older I\'m actually going blind. For real. I\'ve been nearsighted all my life, and once you hit 40 years old you stop being able to see things up close. So font selection becomes this life-or-death thing: it can lock you out of the product completely. But the Chrome team is flat-out arrogant here: they want to build a zero-configuration product, and they\'re quite brazen about it, and Fuck You if you\'re blind or deaf or whatever. Hit Ctrl-+ on every single page visit for the rest of your life.<p>It\'s not just them. It\'s everyone. The problem is that we\'re a Product Company through and through. We built a successful product with broad appeal -- our search, that is -- and that wild success has biased us.<p>Amazon was a product company too, so it took an out-of-band force to make Bezos understand the need for a platform. That force was their evaporating margins; he was cornered and had to think of a way out. But all he had was a bunch of engineers and all these computers... if only they could be monetized somehow... you can see how he arrived at AWS, in hindsight.<p>Microsoft started out as a platform, so they\'ve just had lots of practice at it.<p>Facebook, though: they worry me. I\'m no expert, but I\'m pretty sure they started off as a Product and they rode that success pretty far. So I\'m not sure exactly how they made the transition to a platform. It was a relatively long time ago, since they had to be a platform before (now very old) things like Mafia Wars could come along.<p>Maybe they just looked at us and asked: \"How can we beat Google? What are they missing?\"<p>The problem we face is pretty huge, because it will take a dramatic cultural change in order for us to start catching up. We don\'t do internal service-oriented platforms, and we just as equally don\'t do external ones. This means that the \"not getting it\" is endemic across the company: the PMs don\'t get it, the engineers don\'t get it, the product teams don\'t get it, nobody gets it. Even if individuals do, even if YOU do, it doesn\'t matter one bit unless we\'re treating it as an all-hands-on-deck emergency. We can\'t keep launching products and pretending we\'ll turn them into magical beautiful extensible platforms later. We\'ve tried that and it\'s not working.<p>The Golden Rule of Platforms, \"Eat Your Own Dogfood\", can be rephrased as \"Start with a Platform, and Then Use it for Everything.\" You can\'t just bolt it on later. Certainly not easily at any rate -- ask anyone who worked on platformizing MS Office. Or anyone who worked on platformizing Amazon. If you delay it, it\'ll be ten times as much work as just doing it correctly up front. You can\'t cheat. You can\'t have secret back doors for internal apps to get special priority access, not for ANY reason. You need to solve the hard problems up front.<p>I\'m not saying it\'s too late for us, but the longer we wait, the closer we get to being Too Late.<p>I honestly don\'t know how to wrap this up. I\'ve said pretty much everything I came here to say today. This post has been six years in the making. I\'m sorry if I wasn\'t gentle enough, or if I misrepresented some product or team or person, or if we\'re actually doing LOTS of platform stuff and it just so happens that I and everyone I ever talk to has just never heard about it. I\'m sorry.<p>But we\'ve gotta start doing this right.', '2021-06-25 12:38:47', NULL),

During that entire time, her article stood with a very prominent notice saying it was going to be deleted, with a prominent link allowing people to argue in favor of keeping or, better yet, locate a real reliable source backing up any claim to her notability. Two weeks. Read the AfD. Read DGG\'s exegesis of the sources cited in this article --- the guy found out <i>how many libraries carried her book</i>.<p>Now, think about this: Jessie\'s article wasn\'t a marquee deletion event. Nobody gave a shit. It was just one of many pages up for AfD that week, alongside the founder of a political party nobody has ever heard of and 3 members of non-professional football clubs. <i>In every one of those retarded articles</i>, someone had to marshall real arguments, chase down real sources, and in many cases defend those arguments against both bona fide Wikipedia contributors and also sockpuppets of the subjects of the article. <i>Every time</i>.<p>Anyone who can snark that Wikipedia is a knee-jerk or arbitrary culture is betraying a deep ignorance of how the most successful Internet reference project in the history of the Internet actually works.<p>Something I don\'t get about people on HN and their attitude towards Wikipedia. None of you, not a one, expects Linus Torvalds to accept arbitrary contributions to the Linux kernel simply because that code could be disabled by default and wasn\'t going to bother anyone (unlike a bogus Wikipedia article, which taints the encyclopedia and also Google search results). People with experimental or long-shot Linux contributions (at least, people besides ESR) tend to set up Github pages instead of writing long-winded rants about the \"deletionism\" rampant in the world\'s most successful open source project.

(6, 9, 'Bluestrike2', 'You need to hire an attorney, one who works in business litigation (if you can find someone specializing in minority shareholder disputes, that much the better). Right now. If you&#x27;re delaying on this point out of some idea of wanting to &quot;try to fix things first&quot; or &quot;not wanting to be the bad guy,&quot; you&#x27;re just shooting yourself in the foot and downing blood thinners to keep the wound from clotting. Working with an attorney is not the same as filing suit, and you will never be worse off in this sort of situation for having sought outside counsel. You also need to find your own attorney; the company&#x27;s counsel works for the company itself, not for any of its investors, executives, or employees.<p>Judging from your story, your situation is pretty clear: you&#x27;re being squeezed-out. Sadly, it&#x27;s not uncommon. Though he might not be asking you to leave right now, framing it as in a few months is just an effort to (i) get some additional benefit out of you, and (ii) give them the time they need to break you.<p>There are two possibilities right off the bat: (i) the CEO is involved, which is likely given the difficulty involved in squeezing-out a shareholder +  50% co-founder; (ii)  the CTO is working alone, hoping to push you out the door and benefit in some way from the resulting vacuum. In either case, you can&#x27;t move forward without speaking to an attorney. And don&#x27;t you dare think for one second that you can &quot;just talk to the CEO first.&quot;<p>Already, you&#x27;re talking about things as an employee rather than an owner. That&#x27;s your first mistake. An employee might be able to be kicked to the curb, but you&#x27;re not just an employee. You&#x27;ve already made a significant investment into the company, and from their perspective, an ideal&#x2F;successful squeeze-out is one that deprives you of that ownership interest entirely. Most of these efforts are successful because they manage to position the person being targeted in a position where they just roll over. Ideally, they force the person being squeezed out to choose to quit rather than actually be fired. It seems like that&#x27;s the CTO&#x27;s goal in your situation.<p>That said, there are few programmers, in my opinion, whose work is so bad that there is zero potential for future improvement. Considering the costs of pushing you out, you&#x27;d have to be doing a hell of a lot more than just writing shit code to justify termination. Given that they want to wait until <i>after</i> additional fundraising rounds are completed, I doubt that your involvement with the company is nearly so problematic. Besides, you already stated that there&#x27;s been a clear improvement in your code.<p>I was in a similar situation, once. I was foolish, stupid, and trusted a friend I&#x27;ve known for years. I did the development work, partner A brought his business skills and industry contacts to the table along with his money (and a third partner, B, as well). Did the work, but during that time, there was no sight of their money. One of the earliest clues I was going to be screwed was, when discussing fundraising, A mentioned his own deferred pay. Something I thought slightly peculiar given that he was supposed to be investing his own, significant funds along with B. Plus, I don&#x27;t believe that he actually did any measurable work during the time period that would justify it based on what I knew at the time. Investors are rightly finicky about deferred salaries, and the bar is pretty high to justify them.<p>When we were at the end, I found myself being squeezed-out: in the end, they apparently figured that it&#x27;d be cheaper to outsource to some ridiculous &quot;startup in the box&quot; type of company rather than deal with my deferred pay and the long-term consequences of a third founder&#x27;s ownership interests) even though doing so would delay things by a couple of months. They even managed to time things well: the weekend of my grandmother&#x27;s funeral, after A had been told about it, they dropped their little bomb on me. The only good thing was that they walked away without getting a single line of code that I&#x27;d written.<p>My parting was anything but on good terms. Eventually, I wound up not pursuing the matter in court--talking it over with my attorney, it became quite clear that the legal fees of fighting them would be ruinous. That partner C was a shyster of an attorney, and all evidence suggested that they&#x27;d just try to wait out the expensive clock rather than consider settling. After all, the cost of doing so would be pretty minimal. Litigation is uncertain and expensive. Painful though it may be, you never <i>ever</i> litigate on principle. Not if you have any brains at all.<p>Even though I would have likely prevailed given the facts, I would have come up horribly in the red when it was done. A pyrrhic victory and no more. Choosing not to go down that route was one of the harder decisions of my life, made all the more difficult by the knowledge that they had, quite literally, taken even my grandmother&#x27;s funeral away from me.<p>Oddly enough, I&#x27;m probably better off for it now that I have some distance and perspective to look back. When they launched, it was unobserved and uneventful. Even now, they&#x27;re unknown with almost no traffic and engagement. They&#x27;ve also made a number of bad mistakes that I had identified--often through trial and error--that I had told them about. It was a submarine rigged for silent running, deep and quiet, that&#x27;s never bothered to surface for air. All of partner A&#x27;s vaunted experience and extensive media contacts in the industry proved for naught in the end. Eventually, they&#x27;ll simply wither and die on the vine. Had they not squeezed me out, no doubt I&#x27;d still be hanging on trying to turn things around. After all, who abandons a friend? It was quite the learning experience, albeit an incredibly expensive one.<p>Luckily, you can avoid that sort of experience by acting now to protect yourself. Document everything, save all of your emails, chat logs, download and archive <i>all</i> Github comments on everything that you&#x27;ve worked on, as well as everything else you can. Make sure that you&#x27;re also grabbing copies of emails off any servers&#x2F;accounts they might have access to. Even though it will create problems if there&#x27;s any litigation, there&#x27;s a high likelihood that they&#x27;ll do something foolish such as delete them.<p>You have a lot going for you right now that&#x27;ll help you. First, you&#x27;re obviously still needed to help their raise funds. Second, investors are scared to death of founder disputes. If any potential investors even sniff the possibility, they&#x27;ll run and never look back while your current investors will raise holy hell, even if the CEO+CTO were able to find some fig leaf of justification. It also implies a deviousness that will scare investors; if they&#x27;re willing to screw a friend and risk such a serious dispute, then it&#x27;s also possible that they&#x27;ll wander into similar situations in the future. Particularly in the early stages, investors and VC firms don&#x27;t have to put up with that sort of bullshit.<p>This gives you an absurd amount of leverage: you have the ability to single-handedly kill their fundraising efforts now and in the future. You need to call your attorney and start using it. At the very minimum, it&#x27;ll put the breaks on any plans they&#x27;re currently working on. At best, it&#x27;ll help you move forward as a company without having these sorts of problems lurking about in the shadows.', '2021-06-25 12:38:47', NULL);

I want to get out of the office and get some fresh air.<p>3. I often want to get away from the very people that Joel suggests spending time with on my break.<p>4. I\'m a \"food outlier\".  I hate pizza, deli, and fast food.  I won\'t eat it away from work.  Why should I eat it there?<p>5. Sometimes I want a beer with my lunch.<p>6. Sometimes I just want to close my eyes for 5 minutes.<p>7. If my work mates are talking about something other than work, I\'m probably not interested.  I\'d rather chew razor blades than talk about traffic, weather, casino gambling, baseball, real estate taxes, gun control, politics, or Dancing with the Stars.  I\'d rather shoot myself than hear <i>anything</i> about their children.<p>8. If I am going to talk about work, I will want to bitch about the boss.  Tough to do if he/she is there.<p>9. If I am going to talk about work, I want everyone else to talk freely and openly.  This never happens.  They will bitch about anyone else if they\'re not there, but when we\'re all together, they act like everything is just peachy.  Phoneys.<p>10. \"Enforced association\" is phoney.

(9, 9, 'confluence', 'Here are a few tips for others startup employees:<p>1. Take the least amount of stock possible - your startup is statistically unlikely to succeed. It\'d be better to bump your salary up $10-20K than to get the stock.<p>2. Unless it\'s liquid - it\'s worthless.<p>3. Valuations pre-cashflow - are useless. Anybody can value anything at insane levels using just one dollar. I value HN at $1 billion by offering to buy only 1 share of 1 billion in common stock for $1 right now. See the implicit valuation leverage. I took a dollar, then invented the billion.<p>4. If you work for a \"nasty\" startup - one which people can consider to be negative long term to one or more parties - expect eventual collapse or flat line growth (Zynga/Groupon).<p>5. Companies exist to make management, investors and founders rich - they hold the vast majority of the stock - and benefit greatly from path dependence and network effects. You on the other hand don\'t. Expect to be screwed at any time.<p>Think of it like this. Managers/founders of most companies are pretty dipshit - how is it that they can own so much more stock? Simple. Be there earlier! Akin to how old money works. Imagine if you were the first person to squat land near what has now become Manhattan. You\'d easily be worth hundreds of millions. There is obviously some skill in researching, predicting, working and acquiring land that will soon appreciate in value. But it\'s not worth nearly that much. Path dependence, luck and network effects do that. See GFC boom and that dumbass cousin who made and almost certainly lost millions in housing to understand how this works out.<p>Startups really aren\'t that different to a speculative investment in a house during boom times. Once you understand this - a lot of things start to make a hell of a lot more sense.<p>6. PG says be relentlessly resourceful. That\'s useful. But even better is to be relentlessly cynical.<p>Free t-shirts? Just an easy way to drop your salary and indoctrinate you - scratch that - it\'s a god damn uniform - freedom be damned! Free food? You took a $30-$40K pay cut to take the damn job - the food isn\'t worth a tenth of that + you\'re now working during lunch hours! Free hardware? That\'s only $2-$4K.<p>Hackathons? That\'s just work during your free time - or if it\'s during work time, it\'s a startup product you should own, but don\'t. More days off? Aren\'t you already working 60+ hours a week today! Culture shit after work? That\'s just more indoctrination. Gym membership? Only $200-500 - peanuts! Flexible work hours? That just means work more, but do it at times that aren\'t 9-5. Parental leave? Big companies and Europe have had that for ages.<p>Oh, and that culture fit crap? That\'s just discrimination - rebranded! What? You don\'t like what other late 20s upper-class educated males like? Be gone heathen!<p>End advice.<p>Not saying big companies or government jobs are any better.
